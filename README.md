# Red alerts on Israel's map
Red alerts since October 7th 2023 in Israel displayed on a map throughout a year of war.

I was bored so I decided to create an animation to display the red alerts Israel got since the beginning of the war in Google Colab. 

Red alerts file taken from (I took the file when it was updated until 13th of October 2024):

Coordinates file taken from:

    https://data-israeldata.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/a589d87604c6477ca4afb78f205b98fb/explore

I tried to match the cities in the coordinates file and alarms file, but I was too lazy to continue to match most of the unmatched locations.
